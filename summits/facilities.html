    <p>
        The third Workflows Community Summit will explore workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of
        computing centers and facilities. The summit is the third in the series organized by the NSF workflowsRI and DOE
        <a href="https://exaworks.org" target="_blank">ExaWorks</a> projects, and builds on two prior workshops that 1)
        established a high level vision for workflows research; and 2) explored technical approaches for realizing that
        vision.
    </p>

    <p>
        A summary of the previous workshops is available in two technical reports
        (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4606958" style="border: 0" target="_blank">

        and

            <img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4915801.svg" alt="DOI"

        and an invited paper
        (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02168" target="_blank"><img
            src="https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2110.02168-blue" alt="arXiv"
            style="transform: none; -webkit-transform: none; position: inherit; margin: 0"></a>) at the WORKS workshop
        describing the community roadmap.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third workshop will bring together a small group of facilities representatives (one per facility) with the
        aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact
        with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are
        for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.
